# Metajudge ⚖️

Metajudge provides an integrated environment to ensure that judgments on complex data, such as user fitness insights, are accurate, consistent, and high-quality. 

It was built to solve the challenge of manually cross-referencing an AI's reasoning against a user's historical data by presenting all necessary information on a single, intuitive screen.

## Key Features

* **Integrated Three-Panel View:** See the original insight, the judge's evaluation, and the user's complete workout history all at once, eliminating the need to switch between different files.
* **Contextual Auto-Search:** Highlight any text in the insight or explanation (like an exercise name or a date), and Metajudge automatically searches and highlights all occurrences in the user's workout history.
* **Hotkeys:** Navigate and assess with maximum speed. Assign ratings (`1`, `2`, `3`). Tab through searched occurences (`A`, `D`).
* **Automatic Progress Saving:** Never lose your work. Metajudge automatically saves your progress after every assessment.
* **Flexible Data Export:** Export your completed reviews to a CSV file, sorted either by insight or by judge category.
* **Statistics:** Quickly view aggregate statistics on issue rates for each judge category to identify systemic problems.
